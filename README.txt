This exercise builds off the roman numerals exercise from 'ruby-basics'.
Use the code in the 'array_exercise' file.

1) Make sure you understand how it works.
2) The code repeats itself ALOT.
3) Refactor the code using a nested array with two sub-arrays. The first sub-array containing the number value and the second sub-array using the roman-numeral value.
    i.e. [[1000, 900, ...] , ['M', 'CM', ...]]
4) You should be able to do the roman numeral conversion using only a 'while loop' and a single 'if statement'.
