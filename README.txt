This exercise builds off the roman numerals exercise from 'ruby-basics'.
Use the code in the 'array_exercise' file.

1) Make sure you understand how it works.
2) The code repeats itself ALOT.
3) Refactor the code using a nested array.
    i.e. Numbers and roman numerals stored in: [[1000, 900, ...] , ['M', 'CM', ...]] or [[1000, 'M'] , [900, 'CM'] , ...]
4) You should be able to do the roman numeral conversion using only a 'while loop' and a single 'if statement' (or similar).
